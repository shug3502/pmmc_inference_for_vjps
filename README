This code implements a particle MCMC algorithm for inference of the parameters of a velocity jump process model.
A bootstrap particle filter is used to obtain an estimate of the likelihood of observed data given certain parameters.
This is used in a standard Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampler.
The emission probabilities for the particle filter give the probability of observing a certain angle change, given a known pattern of hidden states. 
The derivation of these is described in our manuscript available at http://www.dtc.ox.ac.uk/people/14/harrisonj/

To run pmmh_simplified.r with command line arguments, ensure that you are in the correct working directory, and use:
Rscript --vanilla pmmh_simplified.r unique_identifier sigma dt t_end seed

For example:
Rscript --vanilla pmmh_simplified.r simplified_v01 0 4 128 123
This example took 112 seconds to run on a Linux desktop machine.
